# CDJ1000-Nexus-MOD
This is a on-going project to create a skin for DJ software "MIXXX" to make a CDJ1000mk3 MIDI moded work as a Nexus CDJ2000 model

Pioneer inspired theme for smaller screen resolutions. It has been designed to 'extend' a MIDI controller.

This project is being developed using ChatGPT as im not a poeficient coder/programmer so bear in mind that the code may seam weird for a professional programmer.


Inspired by: ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyrJW7Vaf68)).
